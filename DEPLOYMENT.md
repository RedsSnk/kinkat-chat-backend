# Deployment and Scaling

This document provides guidance on deploying and scaling the chat application.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, you'll need a server with Node.js installed. You can use a cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean.

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start the Application:**
    ```
    npm start
    ```

    It's recommended to use a process manager like PM2 to keep the application running in the background.

    ```
    npm install -g pm2
    pm2 start index.js
    ```

## Scaling

As the number of users grows, you may need to scale the application to handle the increased load. Here are some recommendations:

*   **Use a Reverse Proxy:** Use a reverse proxy like Nginx or HAProxy to load balance traffic between multiple instances of the application.

*   **Use a Database:** Replace the in-memory user store with a proper database like Redis or MongoDB. This will allow you to share user data between multiple application instances.

*   **Use a Message Broker:** For very large-scale applications, consider using a message broker like RabbitMQ or Kafka to handle communication between different parts of the system.

*   **Horizontal Scaling:** Run multiple instances of the application on different servers to distribute the load. You'll need to use a tool like Socket.io's Redis adapter to share state between instances.
